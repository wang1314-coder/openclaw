OpenClaw's official Zalo personal channel plugin, supporting zero-config login authorization via Zalo Mini App QR code scanning.

## Compatibility

| Plugin Version | OpenClaw Version | npm dist-tag | Status        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0.1.x          | >=2026.4.10      | `latest`     | Active / Beta |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **>= 22**
- [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install) must be installed (`openclaw` CLI available).
- A Zalo account on a mobile device to scan the login QR code.

## Quick Install

Run the following command to install the plugin, enable it, and launch the QR login flow:

```bash
npx -y @zalo-platforms/openclaw-zaloclawbot-cli install
```

## Manual Installation

If the quick installer script does not fit your environment, follow these steps manually:

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install "@zalo-platforms/openclaw-zaloclawbot@0.1.1"
```

Use the exact pinned version shown above (it matches the official catalog entry), so OpenClaw verifies the package against the catalog integrity hash during install.

### 2. Enable the plugin in config

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-zaloclawbot.enabled true
```

### 3. Generate QR code and log in

```bash
openclaw channels login --channel openclaw-zaloclawbot
```

Scan the terminal-rendered QR code using the Zalo mobile app, accept the Terms of Use inside the Zalo Mini App, and authorize the session.

### 4. Restart the gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## How It Works

Unlike the standard developer Zalo channel which requires you to register your own Zalo Official Account (OA) and paste static developer credentials, Zalo ClawBot operates as an **owner-bound personal assistant** using a shared, official infrastructure:

1. **Secure Onboarding:** The QR code resolves to a secure Zalo Mini App that binds a newly-provisioned, private bot under a shared official OA directly to your Zalo User ID.
2. **Owner-Bound Privacy:** By design, the bot is restricted to communicating _only_ with its owner. Messages from other users are dropped at the platform level, making the connection private and secure.
3. **Ban-Safe:** Because the connection utilizes the official Zalo Bot Platform APIs, it is officially sanctioned and does not carry the account suspension risks associated with unofficial browser/web-spoof libraries.

## Under the Hood

The Zalo ClawBot plugin communicates with Zalo APIs via a persistent long-polling message loop. To maintain a clean and lightweight runtime:

- Long-poll connections utilize the `getUpdates` endpoint.
- Webhooks are disabled by default for local desktop/terminal gateway runs.
- Messages are processed client-side and mapped directly to your local agent runtime.

## Troubleshooting

- **QR Login Timeout:** The login token (`zbsk`) expires after 5 minutes for security reasons. If the QR code expires before you scan it, simply rerun the login command to generate a new one.
- **Gateway Fails to Load:** Ensure your OpenClaw host version is `2026.4.10` or higher. Older versions do not support the external npm-plugin installation ledger.
