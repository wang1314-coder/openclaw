/**
 * Microsoft Teams realtime voice bridge.
 *
 * When `realtime.enabled` is set for the msteams provider, a Teams call is wired
 * directly to a speech-to-speech realtime model (e.g. OpenAI / Azure OpenAI
 * Realtime) instead of the STT -> agent -> TTS pipeline. This is the low-latency
 * path: the model listens, thinks, and speaks in one streaming session.
 *
 * Audio crosses the existing msteams WebSocket as PCM 16 kHz, 16-bit mono. The
 * realtime model speaks PCM 16-bit mono at 24 kHz, so we resample on both legs:
 *   caller  16 kHz -> 24 kHz -> model
 *   model   24 kHz -> 16 kHz -> caller
 * The Windows worker reframes the downlink PCM into 20 ms / 640-byte frames, so
 * we can forward arbitrary-length chunks as a single `audio.frame`.
 *
 * The model owns conversation/VAD/turn-taking and answers small talk directly.
 * For anything that needs work (lookups, actions, tools) it calls
 * `openclaw_agent_consult`, which runs the full OpenClaw agent and returns a
 * speakable result; a short "working on it" filler covers longer agent runs.
