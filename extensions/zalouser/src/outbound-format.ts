/**
 * Outbound text post-processing for the Zalo personal-account channel.
 *
 * The Zalo client (both mobile + web) renders agent-style markdown poorly
 * in two specific ways:
 *
 *  1. Triple-dash horizontal rules (`---`, `***`) are rendered as literal
 *     dashes on their own line - never as a separator. They add visual
 *     noise without conveying structure.
 *
 *  2. List items separated by blank lines render with the blank line
 *     preserved, breaking the visual grouping a reader expects from a
 *     markdown list (`- foo\n- bar` reads as one list; `- foo\n\n- bar`
 *     reads as two unrelated items with extra vertical space).
 *
 *     LLM agents often emit lists with surrounding blank lines because
 *     that is what other channels (Slack, Discord, the web playground)
 *     render best. Zalo is the outlier here.
 *
 * This module normalizes outbound text to match what the Zalo client
 * actually renders well. It is intentionally conservative: the patterns
 * only match content that is unambiguously a markdown HR or a blank line
 * inside a list, so plain prose passes through unchanged.
 *
 * Block-aware: the normalizer walks the text fence-by-fence so content
 * inside ``` / ~~~ fenced code blocks passes through verbatim. A `---`
 * line that is part of a YAML / config snippet inside a code fence is
 * NEVER touched, only freestanding HR lines in prose are.
 *
 * Idempotent: the prose transforms only remove characters, never add
 * them, so applying the function twice produces the same output as once.

// Opening fence: 3+ backticks OR 3+ tildes with optional leading
// whitespace and optional info string (e.g. ```typescript). Capture group 1
// is the marker run so we can record its char + length for opener-aware
// close matching.
const FENCE_OPEN_RE = /^[ \t]*(`{3,}|~{3,})[^\n]*$/;
// Closing fence per CommonMark: same fence character as the opener, length
// at least the opener's, and NOTHING but the marker + trailing whitespace
// (no info string). The char + length comparison is done by the caller so a
// `~~~` line inside a ``` block does not prematurely close it.

/**
 * Normalize agent-emitted markdown text for the Zalo personal-account
 * client. Returns the input unchanged for non-string or empty values so
 * callers do not have to guard.
 *
 *  - Strips lines that contain only 3+ dashes or asterisks (HR markers)
 *    outside fenced code blocks.
 *  - Collapses blank lines that sit between list items (`-`, `*`, `1.`
 *    style) into a single newline so the list renders as a tight group.
 *  - Collapses any remaining 3+ consecutive newlines down to 2.
 *  - Leaves the content of ``` / ~~~ fenced code blocks untouched so
 *    YAML frontmatter, config snippets, or any code containing a `---`
 *    line keeps that line intact.
